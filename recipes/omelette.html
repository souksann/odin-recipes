        <h2>How to make the an amazing omelette.</h2>
            <p>Cooking can be daunting at times. Or it can be simple. For me, I try to stick to simplicity, and an omelette is as simple as it gets.

            <p>An omelette's simplicity is within the ingredients. You only need two things and that's it. Easy, simple, and fast.
